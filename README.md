# What to do

* Read the provided code, apis, learn the code base and understand what they do and how they work
* Learn Google protobuf https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers

### Practice
Tic-tac-toe or Xs and Os, is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Follow the provided hello world rpc process and its UAT test example, implement the Tic-tac-toe game for players.

__The following tasks need to be completed in order for the game to be functional:__
1. A player can create a new Tic-tac-toe game
2. The second player can join the existing game
3. Each player can place their X or O in turn
4. Each player can query the game result: WaitMoreJoin, Ongoing, Win, Draw, Lose


### InterviewService/proto
rpc.proto defines the api provided by the service. It has defined 5 rpc apis. HelloWorldRequest is the example api and others are the apis for the practice tasks.

For any proto file change, you should run `mvn clean compile` to re-generate the java code for the changes.
  
### InterviewServiceUAT
It contains a user acceptance test example to demo how to write a test for the rest api you provided.

# Level of Requirements

### Graduates to Junior level
We expect you to be able to:
* Learn and understand how Google protobuf works in this project.
* Read and understand what the example code does.
* Learn, understand and follow the rest api process flow.
* Learn, follow the example, and write your own api implementation.

You **don't** need to implement tasks 1, 2, 3, 4 and the game. You just need to be able to demonstrate the points above.

We expect you to finish those bullet points in less than 3 hours.

### Experienced Candidates
We expect you to finish all points in graduate to junior level as well as meet the requirements listed above to complete the game in no more than 2 hours time.
